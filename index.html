        <ul>
          <li>HTML provides the "framework" or "structure" for an application</li>
          <li>The "head" element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The "body" element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The "p" element is used to write text ie (think paragraph)</li>
          <li>The "ul" element is used to make bulleted lists</li>
          <li>The "li" element is used to indicate items in a list</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS: Stand for "Cascading Style Sheets"</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS provides "style" to an application</li>
            <li>There are three ways to apply CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS</li>
              <ul>Inline CSS: Can be used to change to style of a single element</ul>
              <ul>Internal CSS: By placing the "style" element in the "head" element</ul>
              <ul>External CSS: Allows for seperation of your CSS code making it more managable for larger projects</ul>
                <b> (It is important to note that when doing so you must link your HTML and CSS together) </b>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
